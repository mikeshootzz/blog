Digital minimalism was never something I was aware of. When i was younger I always wanted to have the latest devices. I used to spend close to 9 hours a day on my phone, mostly TikTok of course. One day I stumpled upon a video from a YouTuber calles "Reysu" about how to properly setup a journaling notebook. I was immediately intrigued and wanted to give journaling a shot. Being the nerd I am, i started researching about pens and eventually found the "LAMY Safari" fountain pen. After falling into the pen rabbit hole and getting a Kuru Toga mechanical pencil, i began my journaling journey.

Journaling tought me quite a few important lessons. If it bothers you, write it down. I suffer from anxiety in my day to day life. Actually writing down what goes on in my mind made me much more aware of my state of mind and helped me to calm down. Having a specific action to take when I feel anxious gave me a sense of control over my emotions, which managed to reduce my anxiety significantly.

## The Digital Declutter

Having realized the benefits of journaling and analog writing, I started watching more and more videos about journaling and different notebook setups. So one day YouTube decided to plant yet another new seed in my mind. This time it was a video about using a dumb phone in 2024. At first I didn't bother watching it, but after YouTube kept recommending it to me, I finally gave in and watched it. After watching the video I stated to become more aware and affraid of the time I spent on my phone each day. I held back for a few monts and got talked out of it by my friends.

On my way home from baseball practice one day, my phone battery died and I was forced to just sit there in peace and quited. I realized how much I enjoyed the silence and the peace of mind. So finally I decided to take the plunge and get myself a dumb phone. After yet quite a bit of research I decided to go with the revamped version of the Nokia 3210.
