Digital minimalism was never something I was aware of. When I was younger, I always wanted to have the latest devices. I used to spend close to 9 hours a day on my phone, mostly TikTok, of course. One day I stumbled upon a video from a YouTuber called "Reysu" about how to properly set up a journaling notebook. I was immediately intrigued and wanted to give journaling a shot. Being the nerd I am, I started researching pens and eventually found the "LAMY Safari" fountain pen. After falling into the pen rabbit hole and getting a Kuru Toga mechanical pencil, I began my journaling journey.

Journaling has taught me quite a few important lessons. If it bothers you, write it down. I suffer from anxiety in my day-to-day life. Actually writing down what goes on in my mind made me much more aware of my state of mind and helped me to calm down. Having a specific action to take when I feel anxious gave me a sense of control over my emotions, which managed to reduce my anxiety significantly.

## The Digital Declutter

Having realized the benefits of journaling and analog writing, I started watching more and more videos about journaling and different notebook setups. So one day, YouTube decided to plant yet another new seed in my mind. This time it was a video about using a dumb phone in 2024. At first, I didn't bother watching it, but after YouTube kept recommending it to me, I finally gave in and watched it. After watching the video, I started to become more aware and afraid of the time I spent on my phone each day. I initially wanted to get a dumb phone but held back and eventually got talked out of it by my friends.

Quite a while ago, I tried to declutter my digital life. I deleted all social media apps from my phone and only used them on my iPad. This worked for a bit but cutting my social media usage to zero from one day to the next was just too big of a step for me. Re-downloading the apps was just too easy. I needed a more drastic approach.

On my way home from baseball practice one day, my phone battery died, and I was forced to just sit there in peace and quiet. I realized how much I enjoyed the silence and the peace of mind. So finally, I decided to take the plunge and get myself a dumb phone. After quite a bit of research, I decided to go with the revamped version of the Nokia 3210.

The most important thing for me was to only affect my digital life, not my social life. I still want to keep in touch with my friends and family on their preferred platforms to keep the friction as low as possible. I managed to achieve this by still using my smartphone in the morning, at lunch and in the evening. During the rest of the day, my phone stays turned off and in my backpack. This way, I can still keep in touch with my friends and family, but I'm not constantly distracted by notifications and the urge to check my phone. If they need me, they can call me. If it's important, they can leave a voicemail.

I've been living like this for the past month and have never looked back. I've noticed my mental well-being has improved significantly. Furthermore, I've started to live more in the moment and enjoy the little things in life.

## The next step

After now having decreased my screen usage from 9 hours a day to less than 2, I wanted to further reduce how I use my smartphone during the scheduled times. I downloaded an app called "dumbify" which allows me to create a minimal and distraction-free home screen. I also deleted all social media apps again and only used them on my iPad. This got me into yet another rabbit hole: singe use devices. This idea was further solidified by the following video:

This also got me thinking about getting an iPod. The thought of having a device that only does one thing and does it well was very appealing to me. I found a cheap iPod Nano 3 online and decided to give it a shot. I've been using it for a few days now, and I'm loving it. Having a dedicated device for music is amazing. I can now listen to music without having to pick up my phone. No algorithms, no notificationsâ€”just music.

## Conclusion

First, let's take a look at my current EDC:

- Fountain pen
- Notebook for journaling
- Nokia 3210
- iPod Nano 3
- iPhone

Carrying around all these devices might seem like a hassle, but for me, it's worth it for sure. I've never felt more at peace and in control of my life. I'm more present in the moment and enjoy the little things in life. I'm not constantly distracted by notifications or the urge to check my phone. I'm more focused and productive. I'm more creative and have more time to think. I'm more connected with my friends and family. I'm happier.

Digital minimalism definitely isn't for everyone. But if you're like me and feel like you're constantly distracted by notifications and the urge to check your phone, I can highly recommend giving it a shot. It's not easy, but it's worth it.
