Hello, my name is Mike Ditton, and I am currently embarking on an exciting journey as a system engineer apprentice within the esteemed IT department at Kanton Aargau. With a passion for technology that has been a driving force in my life from a very young age, I have eagerly embraced the opportunity to dive deep into the world of middleware.

Having been a part of this dynamic field for close to a year now, I've had the opportunity to contribute significantly to several projects. Notably, I played a crucial role in the development and deployment of the Kubernetes Platform as a Service (PaaS) project. This particular project was not only challenging but also immensely rewarding, as it allowed me to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Throughout this period, I've accumulated substantial experience with Kubernetes, mastering its intricacies and leveraging its capabilities to create robust, scalable solutions for our IT infrastructure. My involvement in this project has been a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth within the IT sector.

From tinkering with computers as a child to taking on significant responsibilities in complex IT projects, information technology has always been a central part of my existence. I look forward to continuing my development as a system engineer apprentice and to making meaningful contributions to Kanton Aargau and the wider IT community.

Outside of my professional pursuits in the realm of IT, I have a deep-seated passion for sports, particularly baseball. This past December, I had the honor of joining the Sissach Frogs, a team known for its competitive spirit and camaraderie. As a member of the National League B (NLB), I took to the field as an outfielder, a position that demands quick reflexes and a keen eye for the trajectory of the ball. My time with the Frogs has been an exhilarating addition to my life, providing a perfect balance to my technical work and allowing me to indulge in the thrill of team sports.

My journey with the Sissach Frogs has been one of both personal and athletic growth. Recently, I've embarked on a new challenge within the team: pitching. Although I'm relatively new to this aspect of the game, I'm committed to refining my pitching skills with the same dedication I apply to my system engineering apprenticeship. The art of pitching is complex, requiring a blend of power, precision, and strategy, and I am eager to develop these skills further. Stepping onto the mound has offered me a fresh perspective on the game and an opportunity to contribute to my team in new and exciting ways.
