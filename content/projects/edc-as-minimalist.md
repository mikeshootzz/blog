It’s been about four months since I embarked on my journey into digital minimalism, and I thought it was time to share some reflections and highlight the essential everyday carry (EDC) items that have become staples in my life. But first, let’s start by clarifying what digital minimalism truly means. According to Cal Newport, it’s described as:

> *Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life.**

This philosophy isn’t about abandoning technology entirely. Instead, it’s about cutting out unintentional and low-value interactions with tech—removing the clutter to make space for what genuinely enriches your life. For me, this primarily meant addressing binge-scrolling and those endless rabbit holes I didn’t intend to dive into.

In the process, I’ve rediscovered the joy of analog and purposeful activities. I’ve started reading more, and journaling has become a daily ritual that I’ve consistently kept up with. I’ve even rekindled an old passion: retro gaming. While gaming might seem counterintuitive to digital minimalism, for me, it’s a mindful activity—solving puzzles, strategizing, and immersing myself in something intentional rather than mindlessly scrolling.

One exciting addition to my EDC is my newly upgraded iPod—a 5th-generation classic, replacing my older 3rd-gen Nano. I went all out modding it to fit my aesthetic, even installing Rockbox to unlock its full capabilities. To complement the retro vibe, I paired it with a set of Koss Porta Pro headphones, which not only sound fantastic but also fit perfectly into the nostalgic theme I love.

Rounding out my must-have devices is my Miyoo Mini Plus, a compact retro gaming handheld that has become my constant companion alongside the iPod. These two devices are always with me, serving as my go-to sources of entertainment and creativity.

One unexpected realization from these past four months is how much I’ve unlearned my dependence on my phone. Previously, my phone was practically glued to my hand. Now, it spends more time in my bag or tucked away—and I often find myself momentarily forgetting where it even is! It’s a stark contrast to my previous habits and a testament to the mindset shift digital minimalism has inspired.

In a nutshell, this journey has taught me to be more intentional with technology, allowing me to truly enjoy the tools that matter while shedding the digital noise. It’s not about less—it’s about better.
