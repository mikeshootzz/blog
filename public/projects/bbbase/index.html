Born out of a desire to foster a culture of sharing and growth among my peers, BBBase serves as a central hub for students at my professional school to exchange insights, resources, and expertise.\nIn an age where information is abundant yet fragmented, BBBase stands as a beacon of unity, providing a structured yet flexible environment where knowledge is not just consumed but also contributed. The idea stemmed from my admiration for the open-source community, where software is developed in a collaborative public manner. I wanted to harness this principle and apply it to the way we handle educational content—breaking down the silos of learning and allowing information to flow freely among students.\nTo bring this vision to life, I turned to BookStack, an intuitive platform that made it possible to create and organize documentation on a grand scale. With its user-friendly interface and robust features, BookStack was the perfect foundation upon which to build BBBase. It allowed for the categorization of knowledge into shelves, books, chapters, and pages, mirroring the familiar structure of a traditional library but with the accessibility and interconnectedness of the digital age.\nThe project also provided an excellent opportunity to apply the practical skills I had acquired in my professional life, particularly my experience with Keycloak. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution, which was instrumental in securing BBBase. It ensured that only authorized users could access and contribute to the platform, maintaining the integrity and privacy of the knowledge shared.\nIntegrating Keycloak with BookStack was both a challenge and a triumph. It required delving deep into the realms of authentication protocols, user permissions, and system security. The knowledge I gained at work proved invaluable, allowing me to implement a seamless sign-on experience for users of BBBase, which further encouraged participation and engagement.\nThe result of this integration is a platform that not only promotes the sharing of knowledge but also respects the importance of data security and user privacy. It has been rewarding to see students from various disciplines come together, contribute their unique insights, and help each other excel. Each contribution to BBBase, no matter how small, adds to a collective repository of wisdom that benefits the entire school community.\nBBBase is more than just a platform; it’s a testament to the power of collective effort. It exemplifies how technology can be harnessed to enhance our learning experiences and create a more connected and educated community. As the platform continues to grow, I am excited to see the diverse ways in which students will use it to not only share their knowledge but also to inspire and be inspired by others.\nThe journey of developing BBBase has been a blend of passion, innovation, and learning. It stands as proof that when we open the gates of knowledge and allow everyone to contribute, the whole community thrives. Through BBBase, we have created a space where knowledge is open-source, and every student is both a teacher and a learner—a place where information is not just passed down but lifted up by all.\n","wordCount":"538","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2023-12-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-12-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mike Ditton"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/projects/bbbase/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mike Ditton","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/baseball/ title=Baseball><span>Baseball</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/>Projects</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">BBBase</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-12-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;538 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mike Ditton&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/mikeshootzz/blog/blob/main/content/projects/bbbase.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>One of my favorite personal projects so far has been BBBase—a platform that embodies the spirit of collaboration and the open-source ethos, but for the invaluable currency of knowledge.
